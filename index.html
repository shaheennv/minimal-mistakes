		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p class="intro_text">
			Iâ€™m Shaheen, a charismatic designer with  over 3+ years of experience in functional as well as aesthetic interface crafting for various software applications. I believe in the principles of User centric design, specialising in component design, documentation and user behaviour. In course of my association with previous employers viz;  product as well as service companies, I have been successful in obtaining good reviews and recognition for my contributions in design of various apps under  healthcare, sports, education and lifestyle domains. Professionally I call myself a designer, but in free times I love to write programs too. This sums up a quick brief about my skills and interests, for more details, feel free to drill down the sections below.

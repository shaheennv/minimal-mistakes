		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p class="intro_text margin_bottom_60">
			I’m Shaheen, a charismatic designer with  over 3+ years of experience in functional as well as aesthetic interface crafting for various software applications. I believe in the principles of User centric design, specialising in component design, documentation and user behaviour. In course of my association with previous employers viz;  product as well as service companies, I have been successful in obtaining good reviews and recognition for my contributions in design of various apps under  healthcare, sports, education and lifestyle domains. Professionally I call myself a designer, but in free times I love to write programs too. This sums up a quick brief about my skills and interests, for more details, feel free to drill down the sections below.

        <p class="intro_text">
          <strong>Let’s realize ideas.</strong>
          Designing for me starts with laying down the right questions, in a journey to connect and realize ideas.  The journey touches major areas such as market research, competitive  analyses, consulting just to name a few. The right strategy being one of the most critical  elements in the design process.

          <strong>Transforming ideas to deliverable.</strong>
          A strategy appropriately laid becomes my robust design which helps in having a firm base on transforming ideas to realizable deliverable for your app or website. The firm belief of having a holistic outlook favors optimum transition from wireframes to final design by creating prototypes that can envisage end results and deliverable prior to development.

        <p class="intro_text">
          <strong>It’s not worth if its not what you want.</strong>
          The robust design and well laid strategy are perfect ingredients to have a complete overview of the design process and the same is realized by regular meetings, reviews and feedback which has always been my strengths to be on command over the end result, a dream come true for the end user. By sticking onto the basic and improvising with my learning curve through user testing, the best possible solutions for user needs can be identified and the process can be optimized.

          <strong>Designs with you in mind.</strong>
          Being in the shoes of the user helps me get the edge on the requirement and strengthens to reach my goal of having a state-of-art solution for the user that at the same time is a realizable goal for the development team. Keeping the ratio of re-usability as well as ease of the developer, ideas as well as requirements of the user in perfect balance, my objective of having independent designs empathizing user needs are identified and achieved with optimum efficiency.
